Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods and tools to the development and maintenance of high quality software. 
Software engineering plays an important role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that powers various aspect of the modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
The development of programming language.
The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
The introduction of structured programming in the 1970s 
The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requriements: gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design: creating high level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation: writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing: conducting various test to ensure the software meets quality standards.
Deployment: releasing the software to the customer.
Maintenance: providing update and enhancement to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall: sequential approach with distinct phases flowing downward like a waterfall (e.g, requirements,design,implementation)
Agile: iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: responsible for writing the code.
Quality Assurance manager: ensures the software quality 
Project Manager: oversees the planning. execution and delivery of software project.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs are software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing, testing and debugging code (e.g visual studio code, eclipse).
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical debt, changing requirement and tight deadline
strategies to overcome these challenges include; effective communication, prioritization of tasks, agile methodologies.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit: this involves testing individual components.
integration: testing interaction between different components.
system: testing the entire software system.
acceptance: testing the software against users requirements.
It helps identify and fix defects early in the development process leading to a higher quality software.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
prompt engineering is the giving of clear instructions to get the best possible responses from AI
prompt engineering helps avoid getting a confusing answers from the AI as it helps makes your questions clear so you can get a specific response.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
translate a Spanish word, translate this Spanish word to English, more precise.
improved prompt is more effective because you get a more clear and specific answer and it safes time to.
